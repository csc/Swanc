Flax
====

Flax allows for the creation of interactive mobile applications using HTML5, in particular the HTML5 canvas element. Flax is a HTML5 canvas framework.

Flax has touch at its heart and is ideally suited for creating interactive mobile applications.

Flax is an MVC framework, the UI and UX can be separated from the code. Mobile applications can therefore be developed more quickly and with little coding.

Flax supports different mobile platforms and it guarantees the same look and feel across different devices for the same application.

Applications developed with Flax have been deployed to both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

Applications using Flax have been developed on the following platforms:

Apple iOS
Android
Windows Phone 8
Blackberry BB10
Firefox OS
Flax applications will also run on any modern web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element.
