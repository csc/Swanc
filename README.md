# Project Swanc

## Introduction

Swanc allows for the creation of interactive mobile applications using HTML5, in particular the HTML5 canvas element. Swanc is a HTML5 canvas framework.

Swanc has touch at its heart and is ideally suited for creating interactive mobile applications.

Swanc is an MVC framework, the UI and UX can be separated from the code. Mobile applications can therefore be developed more quickly and with little coding.

Swanc supports different mobile platforms and it guarantees the same look and feel across different devices for the same application.

Applications developed with Swanc have been deployed to both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

Applications using Swanc have been developed on the following platforms:

Apple iOS
Android
Windows Phone 8
Blackberry BB10
Firefox OS
Swanc applications will also run on any modern web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element.

## Getting Started

Swanc is very easy to learn and it is possible to create cross platform mobile applications quickly.

Follow the wiki documentation and start with the [My First Example](https://github.com/csc/Swanc/wiki/My-First-Example)
all training documents are available [Here](https://github.com/csc/swanc/wiki).

## How to Get Help

We really want Swanc to be simple to contribute to, and to ensure that you can get started quickly. A big part of that is being available to help you figure out the right way to solve a problem, and to make sure you get up to speed quickly.

You can always reach out and ask for help by email or through the web on the swanc@googlegroups.com mailing list. (membership is required to post.)

If you want to help improve Swanc directly we have a fairly detailed CONTRIBUTING guide in the repository that you can use to understand how develop mobile applications with Swanc and how the project runs, and how to make changes yourself.

We welcome contributions at all levels, including working strictly on our documentation, tests, or code contributions. We also welcome, and value, input about your experiences with Project Swanc.
